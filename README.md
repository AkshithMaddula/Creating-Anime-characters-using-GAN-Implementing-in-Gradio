# Creating-Anime-characters-using-GAN-Implementing-in-Gradio
The "Creating-Anime-characters-using-GAN-Implementing-in-Gradio" GitHub project is a machine learning project that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create anime characters. The project is implemented in Gradio, a web-based interface that allows users to interact with machine learning models.
The project uses a GAN model to generate anime characters by training on a dataset of existing anime characters. The GAN model consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work together to generate new anime characters that are similar to the ones in the dataset.
The project provides a user-friendly interface using Gradio, where users can input parameters such as gender, hair color, and eye color to generate a new anime character. The generated anime character can be downloaded as an image file.
The project is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library for implementing the GAN model. The code is available on GitHub and can be downloaded and run locally.
Overall, the "Creating-Anime-characters-using-GAN-Implementing-in-Gradio" project is a fun and interesting application of machine learning that allows users to generate their own anime characters.
